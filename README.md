My micro-blog. Project-0.

Using HTML, Jquery, Bootstrap and of course, my favorite CSS, I built a simgle page website implementing a form, button, list and delete functions. I started out with a wireframe, userstory and a kanban board on a board (old school style). 

I am definitely very happy with the CSS but need to still get used to correct syntax rules and implementing appropriate functions. I had to look at the solution and work backwards to learn. Hey but it worked, right? Yeah!
